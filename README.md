# Statistical-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Adidas-US-Retail-Data
The project enforces data cleaning and visualization techniques, using python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and numpy, to provide meaningful insight into an employee attraction in a visually attractive format


The visualizations presented here offer a detailed statistical analysis and graphical representation of Adidas US Retail data, using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotalib, Seaborn and Numpy. The dataset includes large variables including dealers -D, invoice date, area, state, city, product, unit sales, sales, total sales, operating benefits, operating margin and sales method. These analysis provide a comprehensive approach to sales performance in different product categories and regions. They reveal strong correlations and distribution patterns, highlighting trends in total sales and operational benefits. The inclusion of monthly sales trends and units sold distribution aids to identify seasonal variations and products popularity. This data driven approach supports strategic decision -making, which provides insight into retail and maximizes the profitability of adidas in the US market.


# Bar Graph:

This Python script visualizes sales data using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn libraries. It reads data from a CSV file and creates a bar chart showing total sales per product. The x-axis represents different products, while the y-axis shows their corresponding total sales. The bars are colored sky blue, and the product names are rotated for better readability. `plt.tight_layout()` is used to ensure the layout fits well before displaying the chart.

#pie chart:

This code reads a CSV file containing sales data using the pandas library. It then groups the data by product and calculates the total units sold for each product. Using matplotlib, a pie chart is created to visually represent the percentage of units sold per product. The chart provides a clear and easy-to-understand breakdown of product performance in the form of a pie chart.
